# Spotify Playlist view

Single-page application that displays a playlist view of top 50 songs from around the world and gives user a possibility to choose another playlist to display.

Layout was coded entirely by myself basing on Figma design that came from a coding challenge at www.invo.academy.
It's design is fully responsive, what was achieved by using flexbox and media queries.

Application is using Spotify Web API to retrieve data of displayed songs. API requests were made with a use of Fetch API.
